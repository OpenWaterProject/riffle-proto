# riffle-proto

The Riffle_328 protoboard is intended to simplify the process of prototyping simple circuits and connecting them to the Riffle_328.  

By plugging it into the 2x7 connector on the end of the Riffle provides access to all 14 pins on the end of the Riffle

Holes are not connected along the longest dimension of the protoboard; the holes *are* connected with small surface traces along the shortest dimension of the board, but these traces can be cut with a knife if needed.
